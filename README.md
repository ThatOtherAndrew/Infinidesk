# Infinidesk

An infinite spatial canvas, for your desktop.

## Why Infinidesk?

The modern PC desktop can feel **claustrophobic** - creative and developer workflows frequently demand access to many apps and tabs at once, resulting in a frantic mess of alt-tabbing through piles of overlapping panes. The position and order of your windows **keeps changing** - which is difficult to keep track of and creates friction in your workflow. This problem is especially bad on the confines of a laptop screen, where screen space is particularly scarce.

Infinidesk is a new, **spatially-oriented** way to navigate your desktop. Drawing inspiration from digital whiteboard apps, windows are positioned on an **infinite canvas**, breaking the bounds of your screen borders. This takes advantage of our intuitive spatial awareness instead of fighting it, well-proven as the [most popular digital note-taking method](https://reports.valuates.com/market-reports/QYRE-Auto-10U1842/global-note-taking-app).

## Key features

- **Wayland-native:** Supports the latest and greatest apps right out of the box.
- **Touchpad gesture support:** Zoom across the canvas with 2-finger pan!
- **Freeform zoom:** Zoom in to fine app details, or out to show more windows!
- **Shell layering:** Run a wallpaper daemon on the bottom layer, or render a taskbar over the top.
- **Built-in annotations:** Draw and markup in and around your windows with a built-in pen tool!
